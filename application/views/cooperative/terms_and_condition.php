                      <li><p>The applicant undertakes to change the name of the cooperative, as originally registered or as amended thereafter, immediately upon receipt of notice or directive from the CDA that the said name is identical or deceptively or confusingly similar to that of any existing cooperative or to any other name already protected by law, or that such name is patently deceptive, confusing or that the same is contrary to laws, morals, good customs, public order or public policy.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The proposed cooperative name shall be reserved for four (4) calendar days, within which the applicant must proceed to fill up the online application forms. Upon the lapse of four (4) calendar days, the cooperative name reservation shall be purged from the system and said cooperative name shall be again available for use. </p></li>
                      <li><p>The proposed cooperative name shall be subject to further evaluation by the processor, reviewer and/or Director of the LRD. Thus, the fact that the name is available for use on the date the same is verified does not necessarily mean that the reserved cooperative name has already been approved. The CDA processor may require waivers or other similar documents.</p></li>

                      <li><p>With respect to computer-generated application forms, as provided above, any alteration, erasure, modification or revision thereof shall result in the automatic denial of the application. </p></li>
